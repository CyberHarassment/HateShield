This folder contains some figures that are used to validate our assumption that "hate videos and non-hate videos follow specific patterns". Different modality features are compressed with PCA and plotted as scatter plot in 2D space. We observed that hate video features are more likely to form clusters (more obvious on OCR and Transcript), which means they share some similarites.
